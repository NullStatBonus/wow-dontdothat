-- UNVERIFIED until a Paladin trainer is captured with /ddt export. Gold costs are left nil.
-- Every Paladin spell family must appear below (a rotation, a tag, an override or `reviewed`);

-- What every Paladin keeps buying, whatever the talents. Hammer of Justice is the stun and interrupt every
-- leveling build uses; Consecration is a Holy talent that Protection and Retribution leveling builds rely on
-- (it counts only while the talent is active). Rebuke is the interrupt.
-- Paladin and Warlock get a free level 40 mount, but the aim is still to save gold, so the core list is the one
-- Icy Veins calls "Recommended Skills to Upgrade" (with Wowhead's spec guides), and the rest wait.
