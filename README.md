# Don't Do That

A World of Warcraft Classic addon that warns you off gold you don't need to spend yet, so you can afford your **level 40** and **level 60** mounts. Works on **Classic Era** and **WoW Forever**, for all nine classes.

## What it does

- **Marks spells you can skip** in the trainer window. A colored **(i)** appears next to each one; hover it for the reason and the cost.
  - Red: *Save your gold*. You won't need it until later.
  - Gold: *Not worth buying yet*. A low-value spell.
  - Blue: *Optional*. Handy now and then, but you can get by without it.
- **Asks before you waste gold.** Buying a spell that isn't recommended, or a non-essential item (armor, weapons, vanity, bags, recipes), a bank or stable slot, COD mail, a talent reset, or your first lesson in a new profession gets a "Buy anyway?" question that says roughly how long it takes to grind that gold back. You can always say yes.
- **Knows your class and spec.** The advice follows your talents, or the spec you choose, and comes from common leveling builds and expert guides (Wowhead, Icy Veins).
- **Shows what you've saved.** The Progress page tallies the gold you've kept and projects your savings up to the mount you're saving for.

It stays on from level 1 until you've bought the mount you chose to stop at. It only ever asks, and you can turn any part off.

## Install

Install it from CurseForge or Wago with your addon manager, or by hand:

1. Copy the `DontDoThat` folder into your AddOns folder:
   - Classic Era: `World of Warcraft/_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns/`
   - WoW Forever: `World of Warcraft/_classic_beta_/Interface/AddOns/`
2. Start the game, or type `/reload`.

## Using it

Type **`/ddt`** to open the settings (also under Options > AddOns). Pick how firmly it nudges you, which kinds of purchases to watch, and which mount to stop at. `/ddt test` shows a sample warning without buying anything.

## Known limits

- Spell advice follows expert guides. You can switch off any spell or kind of advice.
- Talent choices aren't judged; only the cost of resetting is warned about.
- The addon's own text is English. Spell names follow your game's language, and other languages can be added; see [docs/localization.md](docs/localization.md).

## Problems?

Turn on **Advanced > Debug > Record what the addon sees**, do the thing that went wrong, then **Show the report**, copy it and send it with a description and your client (Classic Era or Forever).
