"""Writes DontDoThat/Rules/Data/<Class>.lua from tools/class_plans/<class>.py and the local spell cache.

Every spell family of the class (Forever and Classic Era, in the plan's skill lines) must end up somewhere:
in a rotation, a tag, an override, or the generated `reviewed` list. Names in the plan that are not real
families, and a spell that is both in a rotation and tagged, are reported and stop the run.
Rank skips are the plan's own `skip`, taken from expert leveling guides (Wowhead "Spells to Buy").

Usage: tools/scaffold_class_rules.py CLASS [CLASS ...]      e.g. MAGE WARLOCK
