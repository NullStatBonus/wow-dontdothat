# addon-settings Specification

## Purpose
Gives players a standard place in the game's options to control the addon and to review how it works, using familiar patterns found in other addons.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Options category with subpages
The system SHALL register a "Don't Do That" category under the game's Options > AddOns list with subpages for Home, What to watch, Progress, Advanced, and About.

#### Scenario: Opening settings
- **WHEN** the player opens Options > AddOns
- **THEN** the addon appears with all five subpages

### Requirement: Master and per-feature toggles
The system SHALL provide an overall enable control and independent controls for blocking confirmations, badges and tooltips, alerts, and the Recommended trainer filter, all on by default. The Recommended switch SHALL control whether the filter is offered in the trainer's Filter menu at all, and the menu's own checkbox SHALL remember separately whether the filter is applied.

#### Scenario: First install
- **WHEN** the addon runs for the first time
- **THEN** every toggle is on

#### Scenario: Filter toggle
- **WHEN** the player turns off the Recommended filter setting
- **THEN** supported trainers show all rows and the Filter menu no longer has the Recommended entry

#### Scenario: Addon turned off
- **WHEN** the player turns off the addon while a trainer is open
- **THEN** all rows return at once and the Filter menu no longer has the Recommended entry

#### Scenario: Unticking in the menu
- **WHEN** the player unticks Recommended in the trainer's Filter menu
- **THEN** all rows return, and the entry stays available so it can be ticked again

#### Scenario: Master off
- **WHEN** the overall enable is turned off
- **THEN** no warnings, prompts, or alerts occur

### Requirement: Rules review and controls
The system SHALL display the active rule set organized by class and by what the player is told: Worth buying, Optional, Save your gold, Not worth buying yet, and Ranks to skip. Every list SHALL be divided into titled groups: Worth buying, Optional and Ranks to skip by spec (All specs first, then each spec), Save your gold and Not worth buying yet by why they wait (for example spells for groups and raids, or for level 60), and any skill a Pet Trainer teaches the player's pet in a Pet group that comes last. Skills that come with a class and are never trained, such as a Hunter's Auto Shot, SHALL NOT be listed; trained skills such as Dual Wield and armor proficiencies SHALL be. Every other spell family in a class's rule data and bundled table SHALL appear in at least one list, each with its reason, unless the class's rule data records it as reviewed (a passive, effect or talent grant that is not a purchase), in which case the page SHALL NOT show it. Selecting a class SHALL show an overview above its lists: what each of its specs could keep by following every rule, up to the level 40 mount and up to the level 60 mount side by side, whatever the player has switched off, and how many spells each list holds. Every switch that changes what is flagged (the rule kinds on Tuning, each kind of spell on a class page and each spell in a list) SHALL show beneath it what it is worth in gold: the projected savings with it on minus the savings with it off, with the player's other settings, up to the stop-after mount, and a spell switched off SHALL still show its value. It SHALL let the player switch off any single ability, switch off any tag for a class, switch off any rule kind (skipped ranks, off-spec leaning) from Tuning, and choose a spec per class from Automatic or that class's specs. All switches are on and every class is Automatic by default, and changes apply without a reload.

#### Scenario: Browse Hunter rules
- **WHEN** the player opens the Rules page and selects Hunter
- **THEN** each ability is listed with its icon and reason, each with a switch, along with the tag switches and the My spec dropdown

#### Scenario: Class overview
- **WHEN** the player selects Mage under Advanced > Classes
- **THEN** under "Savings by spec: level 40 / level 60" the page lists Arcane, Fire and Frost, each with its level 40 and level 60 savings, and the number of spells in each list, whatever rules the player has switched off

#### Scenario: Gold on a switch
- **WHEN** the player looks at the skip-ranks switch on Tuning
- **THEN** a muted line under it says what it is worth, such as "Worth about 101g by your level 60 mount", and a switch that changes nothing says it is worth nothing for their spec

#### Scenario: Pet spells
- **WHEN** a Hunter opens Worth buying
- **THEN** Growl, Great Stamina and Natural Armor are in a Pet group after the spec groups

#### Scenario: Waiting spells by reason

- **THEN** the next COD payment uses the game's own dialog and the other two kinds are unaffected

#### Scenario: Back to defaults
- **WHEN** the player confirms Reset all settings on Home
- **THEN** the three switches return to on

### Requirement: Consistent page layout
The system SHALL give every settings page the same structure and look: a title and one-line introduction, then sections each with a heading and a blank line above it, using one type scale and one muted note color throughout, with the same blank line between lines that would otherwise run together (read-only lists, the mounts, and the kept and projected amounts). Amounts SHALL be shown as bulleted lines of a colored label followed by the amount, never in columns, and a page SHALL NOT have two blank lines in a row.

#### Scenario: Same look on every page

- **THEN** each amount is a bulleted colored label followed by the amount, with a blank line between lines

### Requirement: Tuning section
The system SHALL provide a Tuning section on Advanced with the marks and questions switches, the rule kind switches (skipped ranks and off-spec leaning) and a choice of which tiers ask for confirmation and play the warning sound, where any combination of tiers may be chosen. The stop-after-mount choice (level 40 mount or level 60 mount) SHALL be on Home, and the profession near-cap margin and its on/off switch SHALL be in the Professions area of What to watch. Defaults are the current behavior: 25 points, level 60 mount, and only "Save your gold".

#### Scenario: Defaults
- **WHEN** the addon runs for the first time
- **THEN** Tuning shows only "Save your gold" ticked, What to watch shows 25 points, and Home shows the level 60 mount

#### Scenario: Picking several tiers
- **WHEN** the player ticks both "Save your gold" and "Not worth buying yet"
- **THEN** both tiers ask and sound on a purchase attempt

#### Scenario: No tiers
- **WHEN** the player ticks no tier
- **THEN** nothing asks or sounds, and badges and tooltips continue

#### Scenario: Reset

- **THEN** the profession margin and prompt tiers return to their defaults

### Requirement: Alert channel control
The system SHALL let the player pick the sound channel used for the warning sound from Master, Sound effects, Music, Ambience and Dialog, defaulting to Master.

#### Scenario: Picking a channel
- **WHEN** the player picks Dialog
- **THEN** the next warning sound plays on that channel

### Requirement: Home page and nudge level
The system SHALL provide a Home page with the overall on/off control, a choice of how firmly the addon nudges the player, and the "stop warning me after" mount choice. The nudge choice SHALL offer Just mark things (marks only, never asks), Ask me first (marks, asks before buying what the player should wait on) and Ask about everything (also asks about low-value and informational items). Ask me first SHALL be the default. Each option SHALL carry its own one-line explanation. The choice SHALL be read from the saved marks, "Ask before buying" and prompt-tier settings rather than stored on its own, and SHALL show Custom as selected when those settings match none of the three, with a line that says what is set (whether marks are on, whether it asks, and which kinds of spell it asks about) and that choosing a level resets them or that they can be fine-tuned under Advanced > Tuning. Choosing a nudge level SHALL set those settings, and choosing Custom SHALL change nothing.

#### Scenario: Default
- **WHEN** the addon runs for the first time
- **THEN** Home shows Ask me first selected

#### Scenario: Choosing a level
- **WHEN** the player chooses Ask about everything
- **THEN** marks stay on, "Ask before buying" is on, and all three tiers ask

#### Scenario: Custom
- **WHEN** the player changes the prompt tiers in Advanced so that they match none of the three levels
- **THEN** Home shows Custom selected, and says that marks are on and which kinds of spell it asks about

#### Scenario: Sound does not affect the level
- **WHEN** the player turns the warning sound off in Advanced
- **THEN** Home still shows the same nudge level

#### Scenario: Heading and stop choice
- **WHEN** the player opens Home
- **THEN** the levels sit under "When you're about to buy something that can wait", and the stop choice sits under "When to stop warning me" and reads "After my level 60 mount" or "After my level 40 mount"

### Requirement: What to watch areas
The system SHALL provide a What to watch page with four areas, Spells, Professions, Shopping and Other, all on by default. Spells, Professions and Shopping SHALL each have an on/off control; turning one off SHALL stop its marks, questions and sounds without changing the settings inside it. Spells covers class and pet trainers and the Recommended filter, Professions covers profession ranks, the first-time warning when learning a profession, the switch for marking ranks you can't use yet and the skill margin, and Shopping covers vendor and auction house purchases. Other has no control of its own: it holds the bank slot, stable slot and COD mail switches.

#### Scenario: Defaults
- **WHEN** the addon runs for the first time
- **THEN** all four areas are on

#### Scenario: Turning an area off
- **WHEN** the player turns Shopping off
- **THEN** vendor and auction purchases are no longer marked or asked about, and the category modes and minimum price keep their values

#### Scenario: Turning it back on
- **WHEN** the player turns Shopping on again
- **THEN** the category modes and minimum price are as they were

#### Scenario: Profession settings together
- **WHEN** the player opens the Professions area
- **THEN** the warning switch, the switch for ranks they can't use yet and the skill margin are all there

### Requirement: Advanced section
The system SHALL keep the deeper controls on an Advanced page and out of the way of the other pages: Sound & messages (sound, volume channel, cooldown and the on-screen message), Tuning, Classes (the per-class rule review), and Debug. Nothing on Advanced SHALL be needed to use the addon with its defaults.

#### Scenario: Reaching the deep controls
- **WHEN** the player opens Advanced
- **THEN** the sound controls, Tuning, Classes and Debug are each one step away

#### Scenario: Plain defaults
- **WHEN** the player never opens Advanced
- **THEN** the addon behaves with its default tuning, sound and rule switches

### Requirement: Reset all settings
The system SHALL provide one control, on Home, that puts every setting back to its default after the player confirms, and SHALL NOT provide any other settings reset. It SHALL keep the tally and what the addon already knows the player has done (professions asked about and milestones marked complete), and SHALL turn debug recording off.

#### Scenario: Resetting
- **WHEN** the player has changed settings on several pages and confirms Reset all settings
- **THEN** every setting returns to its default and Home shows Ask me first

#### Scenario: Declining
- **WHEN** the player declines the confirmation
- **THEN** no setting changes

#### Scenario: Kept
- **WHEN** the player resets all settings
- **THEN** the tally, the professions already asked about and any milestone marked complete are unchanged

#### Scenario: No other reset controls
- **WHEN** the player looks through Tuning, What to watch and Classes
- **THEN** none of them has a reset control

### Requirement: Projected savings
The system SHALL show on the Progress page the projected savings for the player's character: the trainer gold kept by following the addon's advice up to the level of the mount the player is saving for (the stop-after setting), using the character's spec (detected or chosen) and every current setting, split into Save your gold, Not worth buying yet and Ranks to skip. It SHALL count every purchasable class and pet rank up to that level that the rules would warn about, SHALL NOT count Worth buying or Optional spells or the first rank of a talent, and SHALL price each rank with the price seen at the player's trainer, else the trainer price listed by Wowhead, else an estimate for the rank's level, saying which kinds of price it used.

#### Scenario: Following the plan
- **WHEN** a Frost mage who is saving for the level 40 mount opens Progress
- **THEN** the projected savings add up the prices of the ranks up to level 40 that the rules mark as waiting, low value or skipped

#### Scenario: Settings change the number
- **WHEN** the player switches off the PvP tag
- **THEN** the projected savings drop by the price of the spells that only that tag flagged

#### Scenario: Price from the trainer
- **WHEN** the player has seen a rank's price at a trainer
- **THEN** that price is used in place of the listed one

#### Scenario: Not logged in
- **WHEN** the character cannot be read
- **THEN** the page says to log in on a supported character

### Requirement: Spell switches are saved by spell
The system SHALL save the player's per-spell on/off choices against the spell's identity, so the choices survive a change of client language.

#### Scenario: Language change
- **WHEN** a player turns off warnings for a spell and later starts the game in another language
- **THEN** that spell is still switched off
