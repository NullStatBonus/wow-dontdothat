# purchase-warnings Specification

## Purpose
Shows the player where a gold-spending action is not advised using one consistent set of signals across trainer, talent, respec, and profession surfaces, and asks for confirmation when the client allows it safely.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Consistent warning signals
The system SHALL use the same three signals for every surface: a badge on the affected item, a tooltip line stating the reason and cost, and a confirmation prompt for the defer tier where interception is possible.

#### Scenario: Flagged trainer row
- **WHEN** the player opens a class trainer showing a deferred spell
- **THEN** that row shows a badge and its tooltip includes the reason and cost

### Requirement: Information bubble
The system SHALL provide an information indicator that shows the reason on mouseover and pins it on click.

#### Scenario: Mouseover
- **WHEN** the player hovers the information indicator
- **THEN** the reason is displayed

#### Scenario: Click to pin
- **WHEN** the player clicks the indicator
- **THEN** the details remain visible until dismissed

### Requirement: Confirmation before proceeding
The system SHALL show a confirmation prompt before a purchase proceeds when its verdict tier is one the player chose to be asked about (only defer by default), and SHALL complete the action only if the player confirms.

#### Scenario: Player cancels
- **WHEN** the player declines the prompt
- **THEN** the purchase is not made

#### Scenario: Player confirms
- **WHEN** the player confirms the prompt
- **THEN** the purchase proceeds and is recorded as spent against the rules

#### Scenario: Extra tier chosen
- **WHEN** the player has chosen to be asked about defer-low-value and tries to buy such a spell
- **THEN** the prompt appears

#### Scenario: Tier not chosen
- **WHEN** a tier is not chosen
- **THEN** a purchase of that tier proceeds with no prompt, and its badge and tooltip still show

### Requirement: Graceful degradation
The system SHALL fall back to badge and tooltip on any surface where a confirmation prompt cannot be provided safely, and SHALL NOT silently do nothing.

#### Scenario: Interception unavailable
- **WHEN** a surface cannot be intercepted without risk of breaking the default interface
- **THEN** the badge and tooltip are still shown

### Requirement: No interference with the default interface
The system SHALL NOT break or disable the default trainer, talent, or profession interfaces, and SHALL NOT produce interface errors from its warning logic.

#### Scenario: Warning logic fails
- **WHEN** evaluating a row raises an error
- **THEN** the default interface continues to work and the error is logged when debugging is on

### Requirement: Covered surfaces
The system SHALL annotate class trainer services, talent selection, talent respec, pet or beast training services, profession trainer services for supported classes and professions, vendor purchases of flagged item categories, and auction house bids and buyouts of flagged item categories.

#### Scenario: Respec dialog
- **WHEN** the game opens its talent reset dialog while warnings are active
- **THEN** the warning sound plays and an Accept / Cancel question states the price and that it rises each time; accepting resets the talents, and cancelling leaves them alone

#### Scenario: Pet training reset
- **WHEN** the game opens its pet skill reset dialog while warnings are active
- **THEN** the warning sound plays and an Accept / Cancel question states the price; if the game refuses the addon's confirmation, the game's own dialog is left in place with a note added

#### Scenario: Flagged vendor item
- **WHEN** the player buys an item from a vendor in a category whose mode includes Vendor, at or above the minimum price
- **THEN** the warning sound plays and an Accept / Cancel question is shown before the purchase

#### Scenario: Flagged auction
- **WHEN** the player bids on or buys out an auction in a category whose mode includes AH, at or above the minimum price
- **THEN** the warning sound plays and an Accept / Cancel question is shown before it is placed

### Requirement: Independent switches
The system SHALL let the player independently turn off blocking confirmations, badges and tooltips, alerts, and the Recommended trainer filter, with all on by default.

#### Scenario: Confirmations off
- **WHEN** blocking confirmations are disabled
- **THEN** no prompt appears but badges and tooltips continue

#### Scenario: Filter off
- **WHEN** the Recommended trainer filter is disabled
- **THEN** trainers show all rows and badges and tooltips continue

### Requirement: Inactive when not applicable
The system SHALL show no warnings for unsupported classes or professions, or after the level 60 mount has been acquired.

#### Scenario: Unsupported class
- **WHEN** the player is a class with no rule data
- **THEN** no warnings are shown

### Requirement: Recommended trainer filter
The system SHALL add a "Recommended" entry to the class and profession trainer's existing filter list that hides services whose verdict is defer or defer-low-value, and SHALL leave keep and informational services visible. It is in addition to badges, tooltips, and prompts.

#### Scenario: Flagged rows hidden
- **WHEN** Recommended is checked and the trainer lists a deferred spell
- **THEN** that row is not shown

#### Scenario: Kept rows stay
- **WHEN** Recommended is checked and the trainer lists a keep or informational spell
- **THEN** that row remains shown

#### Scenario: Filter unchecked
- **WHEN** Recommended is unchecked
- **THEN** all rows are shown and flagged rows keep their badge and tooltip

### Requirement: Recommended filter default
The system SHALL have the Recommended filter checked by default whenever the addon is enabled, and SHALL NOT add text of its own to the trainer window.

#### Scenario: First visit
- **WHEN** the player opens a supported trainer for the first time
- **THEN** the Recommended entry is checked

### Requirement: Filter never alters purchase targets
The system SHALL ensure that activating any visible trainer row sends the service index of the service that row displays, and SHALL NOT change which index purchase calls receive.

#### Scenario: Purchase from a filtered list
- **WHEN** rows are hidden and the player buys the third visible row
- **THEN** the spell shown on that row is the spell purchased

### Requirement: Filter scope and inactivity
The system SHALL apply the Recommended filter to class, profession, and pet trainer windows, not the Beast Training window, and SHALL show all rows, without offering the Recommended entry, when the addon is off. It SHALL also show all rows when the level 60 mount has been acquired or the class is unsupported.

#### Scenario: Deferral finished
- **WHEN** the level 60 mount has been acquired
- **THEN** the trainer shows all rows

### Requirement: Filter degrades safely
The system SHALL fall back to badge and tooltip when the Recommended filter cannot be installed safely, SHALL log the reason when debugging is on, and SHALL NOT hide any rows in that case.

#### Scenario: Install fails
- **WHEN** the trainer window differs from what the filter expects
- **THEN** all rows remain visible and flagged rows show badges and tooltips

### Requirement: One-time warning when learning a non-gathering profession
The system SHALL, when the player trains a profession other than Skinning, Herbalism, or Mining at a profession trainer before the level 60 mount has been acquired, play the warning sound and show an Accept / Cancel question that names the profession, its cost when known, and a reason specific to that profession, and SHALL complete the training only if the player accepts. It SHALL ask at most once per profession: after the player has been asked about a profession, in either answer, later trainings of that profession SHALL NOT trigger the question again.

#### Scenario: First time learning a crafting profession
- **WHEN** a player who has not been asked about Leatherworking trains it
- **THEN** the warning sound plays and a question names Leatherworking, its cost, and why it is not advised yet
- **THEN** accepting trains the profession and cancelling leaves it untrained

#### Scenario: Asked once only
- **WHEN** the player cancelled the question for Engineering earlier and later tries to train it again
- **THEN** no question is shown and the training proceeds

#### Scenario: Gathering professions
- **WHEN** the player trains Skinning, Herbalism, or Mining
- **THEN** no question is shown

#### Scenario: Question not safe
- **WHEN** a question cannot be shown safely on the profession trainer
- **THEN** the system falls back to a badge and tooltip and does not block the training

#### Scenario: Respects existing switches
- **WHEN** the player has turned off blocking confirmations or the addon is off
- **THEN** no question is shown, and the profession is not recorded as asked about
