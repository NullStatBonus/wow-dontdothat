# Module contracts (shared by parallel workstreams)

Conventions
- Lua 5.1 syntax (WoW). Every addon file starts `local addonName, ns = ...` and attaches its module to `ns`. No new globals except SavedVariables (`DontDoThatDB`) and slash command registration.
- `Rules/**` and `Model/**` are pure Lua: no WoW API calls, no Ace libs, no frames. They take plain tables in and return plain tables, so they run under `tests/run.lua`.
- Anything that calls a WoW API must guard it (`if C_Foo and C_Foo.Bar then`) and wrap fragile calls in `pcall`. Forever API names are unverified until the probe runs; do not assume them.
- Money is always integer copper in data and logic.
- A new file goes in both TOC files, in load order (`tools/check-tocs-match.sh` checks they agree). Spell tables and `Locales/enUS.lua` load before the rule data.

Spell identity (Model/SpellData.lua)

A spell is identified by its family ID, never by its displayed name, so a verdict is the same in every client language. A family is every rank of one spell; its ID is the lowest row ID (primary or alternate) the bundled tables hold for that English name in the class. Pet spells sit in their owner's table and no name repeats across kinds within a class.

```
SpellData.FamilyId(class, englishName)  -> familyId | nil     rule files are written with English names; resolve once at load
SpellData.FamilyOfId(class, anyRowId)   -> familyId | nil     accepts any row ID or alternate, so a saved ID outlives a table rebuild
SpellData.FamilyName(class, familyId)   -> English name | nil tests and the debug report only
SpellData.NameMap(class, env)           -> { [clientName] = familyId | false }   false = two families share the name
SpellData.DisplayName(class, familyId, env) -> the client's name for the family, English when the client cannot say
```

The game gives a trainer row's spell ID through its tooltip (`SetTrainerService(i)` then `GetSpell()`); `Adapter.ReadTrainer` sets `row.spellId` and `row.familyId = FamilyOfId(class, spellId)`. Only when that gives nothing, resolve with `NameMap(class, env)[row.name]`. Take the rank from the digits of the rank text. Build the map once per class and session; it is the only place the client's spell names are read. Rules/** and Model/** stay free of WoW API calls: `env` is passed in, as `IconFor` does. A missing or erroring `GetSpellInfo` leaves the English names in the map, which is today's behavior. `Probe.SpellIdentity` records whether a client gives the trainer a direct spell ID.
